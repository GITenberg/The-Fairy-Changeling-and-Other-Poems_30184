1</span>THE FAIRY CHANGELING</h2>
<p class="poetry">Dermod O&rsquo;Byrne of Omah town<br />
In his garden strode up and down;<br />
He pulled his beard, and he beat his breast;<br />
And this is his trouble and woe confessed:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The good-folk came in the night, and
they<br />
Have stolen my bonny wean away;<br />
Have put in his place a changeling,<br />
A weashy, weakly, wizen thing!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;From the speckled hen nine eggs I
stole,<br />
And lighting a fire of a glowing coal,<br />
I fried the shells, and I spilt the yolk;<br />
But never a word the stranger spoke:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;A bar of metal I heated red<br />
To frighten the fairy from its bed,<br />
To put in the place of this fretting wean<br />
My own bright beautiful boy again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But my wife had hidden it in her
arms,<br />
And cried &lsquo;For shame!&rsquo; on my fairy charms;<br />
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>She sobs, with the strange child on her breast:<br />
&lsquo;I love the weak, wee babe the best!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">To Dermod O&rsquo;Byrne&rsquo;s, the tale to
hear,<br />
The neighbours came from far and near:<br />
Outside his gate, in the long boreen,<br />
They crossed themselves, and said between</p>
<p class="poetry">Their muttered prayers, &ldquo;He has no
luck!<br />
For sure the woman is fairy-struck,<br />
To leave her child a fairy guest,<br />
And love the weak, wee wean the best!&rdquo;</p>

3</span>A BALLAD OF MARJORIE</h2>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What ails you that you look so pale,<br

O fisher of the sea?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for a mournful tale I own,<br />
Fair maiden Marjorie.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What is the dreary tale to tell,<br />
O toiler of the sea?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I cast my net into the waves,<br />
Sweet maiden Marjorie.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I cast my net into the tide,<br />
Before I made for home;<br />
Too heavy for my hands to raise,<br />
I drew it through the foam.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What saw you that you look so pale,<br
/>
Sad searcher of the sea?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;A dead man&rsquo;s body from the deep<br />
My haul had brought to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And was he young, and was he
fair?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, cruel to behold!<br />
In his white face the joy of life<br />
Not yet was grown a-cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span

prayer<br />
For one who sails the sea.&rdquo;<br />

Poor maiden Marjorie.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What said he, that you seem so sad,<br
/>
O fisher of the sea?<br />
(Alack! I know it was my love,<br />
Who fain would speak to me!)&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Beware a woman&rsquo;s
mouth&mdash;<br />
A rose that bears a thorn.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ah, me! these lips shall smile no more<br />
That gave my lover scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Beware a woman&rsquo;s
eyes.<br />
They pierce you with their death.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Then falling tears shall make them blind<br />
That robbed my dear of breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Beware a woman&rsquo;s
hair&mdash;<br />
A serpent&rsquo;s coil of gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Then will I shear the cruel locks<br />
That crushed him in their fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Beware a woman&rsquo;s
heart<br />
As you would shun the reef.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;So let it break within my breast,<br />
And perish of my grief.&rdquo;</p>

6</span>THE PRIEST&rsquo;S BROTHER</h2>
<p class="poetry">Thrice in the night the priest arose<br />
From broken sleep to kneel and pray.<br />
&ldquo;Hush, poor ghost, till the red cock crows,<br />
And I a Mass for your soul may say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thrice he went to the chamber cold,<br />
Where, stiff and still uncoffin&egrave;d,<br />
His brother lay, his beads he told,<br />
And &ldquo;Rest, poor spirit, rest,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thrice lay the old priest down to sleep<br />
Before the morning bell should toll;<br />
But still he heard&mdash;and woke to weep&mdash;<br />
The crying of his brother&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">All through the dark, till dawn was pale,<br />
The priest tossed in his misery,<br />
With muffled ears to hide the wail,<br />
The voice of that ghost&rsquo;s agony.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last the red cock flaps his wings<br />
To trumpet of a day new-born.<br />
The lark, awaking, soaring sings<br />
Into the bosom of the morn.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>The priest before the altar stands,<br
/>
He hears the spirit call for peace;<br />
He beats his breast with shaking hands.<br />
&ldquo;O Father, grant this soul&rsquo;s release.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Most Just and Merciful, set free<br />
From Purgatory&rsquo;s awful night<br />
This sinner&rsquo;s soul, to fly to Thee,<br />
And rest for ever in Thy sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Mass is over&mdash;still the clerk<br />
Kneels pallid in the morning glow.<br />
He said, &ldquo;From evils of the dark<br />
Oh, bless me, father, ere you go.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Benediction, that I may rest,<br />
For all night did the Banshee weep.&rdquo;<br />
The priest raised up his hands and blest&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Go now, my child, and you will sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The priest went down the vestry stair,<br />
He laid his vestments in their place,<br />
And turned&mdash;a pale ghost met him there,<br />
With beads of pain upon his face.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have
gained me peace,<br />
But why so long did you know my tears,<br />
And say no Mass for my soul&rsquo;s release,<br />
To save the torture of all those years?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span

the good priest said,<br />
&ldquo;No years have passed&mdash;but a single night.&rdquo;<br

He showed the body uncoffin&egrave;d,<br />
And the six wax candles still alight.</p>
<p class="poetry">The living flowers on the dead man&rsquo;s
breast<br />
Blew out a perfume sweet and strong.<br />
The spirit paused ere he passed to rest&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;God save your soul from a night so long.&rdquo;</p>

9</span>THE BALLAD OF THE LITTLE BLACK HOUND</h2>
<p class="poetry">Who knocks at the Geraldine&rsquo;s door
to-night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the black storm and the rain?<br />
With the thunder crash and the shrieking wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes the moan of a creature&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">And once they knocked, yet never a stir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To show that the Geraldine knew;<br />
And twice they knocked, yet never a bolt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The listening Geraldine drew.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thrice they knocked ere he moved his
chair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And said, &ldquo;Whoever it be,<br />
I dare not open the door to-night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a fear that has come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Three times he rises from out his chair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And three times he sits him down.<br />
&ldquo;Now what has made faint this heart of mine?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He says with a growing frown.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&ldquo;Now what has made me a coward
to-night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who never knew fear before?<br />
But I swear that the hand of a little child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeps pulling me from the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Geraldine rose from his chair at last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And opened the door full wide;<br />
&ldquo;Whoever is out in the storm,&rdquo; said he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;May in God&rsquo;s name come
inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He who was out in the storm and rain<br />

Seared flesh, shrieked out their patient years of pain.<br />
Crying to Death for their lost plains of Heaven.<br />

All the boats at anchor they are plunging to be free&mdash;<br />
O to be a sailor, and away across the sea!<br />
When the sky is black with thunder, and the sea is white with
foam,<br />
The gray-gulls whirl up shrieking and seek their rocky home,<br
/>
Low his boat is lying leeward, how she runs upon the gale,<br />
As she rises with the billows, nor shakes her dripping sail.<br
/>
There is danger on the waters&mdash;there is joy where dangers
be&mdash;<br />
Alas! to be a woman and the nomad&rsquo;s heart in me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span

on the shore&mdash;<br />
With a soul that finds a passion for each long breaker&rsquo;s
roar,<br />
With a heart that beats as restless as all the winds that
blow&mdash;<br />
Thrust a cloth between her fingers, and tell her she must sew;<br
/>
Must join in empty chatter, and calculate with straws&mdash;<br
/>
For the weighing of our neighbour&mdash;for the sake of social
laws.<br />
O chatter, chatter, chatter, when to speak is misery,<br />
When silence lies around your heart&mdash;and night is on the
sea.<br />
So tired of little fashions that are root of all our strife,<br

Of all the petty passions that upset the calm of life.<br />
The law of God upon the land shines steady for all time;<br />
The laws confused that man has made, have reason not nor
rhyme.</p>

quiet?<br />
No!&mdash;for all its dangers, there is joy in danger too:<br />
On, bird, and fight your tempests, and this nomad heart with
you!</p>

mouths one day,<br />
The storms that shriek and whistle will blow our breaths away.<br

The dust that flies and whitens will mark not where we trod.<br

my brother&mdash;<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And for your soul&mdash;to save it from

She rose, and weeping, left the little chapel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went forward blindly till she reached the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">She dug a grave within the surf and shingle,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A dark, cold bed, made very deep and wide,<br />
She laid her down all stiff and stretched for burial,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Right in the pathway of the rising tide.</p>
<p class="poetry">First tossed into her waiting arms the
restless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loud waves, a woman very grey and cold,<br />
Within her bed she stood upright so quickly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loosed her fingers from the dead hands&rsquo;
hold.</p>
<p class="poetry">The second who upon her heart had rested<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the storm, a baby chill and stark,<br />
With one long sob she drew it on her bosom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then thrust it out again into the dark.</p>
<p class="poetry">The last who came so slow was her own lover,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; She kissed his icy face on cheek and chin,<br />
&ldquo;O cold shall be your house to-night, beloved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O cold the bed that we must sleep within.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And heavy, heavy, on our lips so
faithful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on our hearts, shall lie our own
roof-tree.&rdquo;<br />
And as she spoke the bitter tears were falling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On his still face, all salter than the sea.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>&ldquo;And oh,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;if for a little moment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You knew, my cold, dead love, that I was by,<br />
That my soul goes into the utter darkness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When yours comes forth&mdash;and mine goes in to
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And as she wept she kissed his frozen
forehead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid her warm lips upon his mouth so chill,<br />
With no response&mdash;and then the waters flowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into their grave, grew heavy, deep and still.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">And so, &rsquo;tis said, if to that fairy
thorn-tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You dare to go, you see her ghost so lone,<br />
She prays for love of her that you will aid her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give your soul to buy her back her own.</p>

95</span>THE SUICIDE&rsquo;S GRAVE</h2>
<p class="poetry">This is the scene of a man&rsquo;s despair, and
a soul&rsquo;s release<br />
From the difficult traits of the flesh; so, it seeking peace,<br
/>
A shot rang out in the night; death&rsquo;s doors were wide;<br
/>
And you stood alone, a stranger, and saw inside.</p>
<p class="poetry">Coward flesh, brave soul, which was it?&nbsp;
One feared the world,<br />
The pity of men, or their scorn; yet carelessly hurled<br />
All on the balance of Chance for a state unknown;<br />
Fled the laughter of men for the anger of God&mdash;alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">Perhaps when the hot blood streamed on the
daisied sod,<br />
Poor soul, you were likened to Cain, and you fled from God;<br />
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Men say you fought hard for your life, when the deed was
done;<br />
But your body would rise no more &rsquo;neath this world&rsquo;s
sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;d choose&mdash;should I do the
act&mdash;such a night as this,<br />
When the sea throws up white arms for the wild wind&rsquo;s
kiss;<br />
When the waves shake the shuddering shore with their foamy
jaws;<br />
Tear the strand, till slipping pebbles shriek through their
claws.</p>
<p class="poetry">The sky is loud with the storm; not a bird dare
span<br />
From here to the mist; beasts are silent; yet for a man,<br />
For a soul springing naked to meet its judge, a night<br />
That were as a brother to this poor spirit&rsquo;s long
flight.</p>
<p class="poetry">But he had chosen, they tell me, a dusk so
fair<br />
One almost thought there were not such another&mdash;there.<br />
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>The air was full of the perfume of pines, and the
sweet<br />
Sleepy chirp of birds, long the lush soft grass at his feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">They say there was dancing too in a house close
by,<br />
That they heard the shot just thinking wild birds must die.<br />
They supped and laughed, went singing the long night through,<br
/>
And they danced unknowing the dance of death with you.</p>
<p class="poetry">What did you hear when you opened the doors of
death?<br />
Was it the sob of a thrush, or a slow sweet breath<br />
Of the perfumed air that blew through the doors with you,<br />
That you fought so hard to regain the world you knew?</p>
<p class="poetry">Or was it a woman&rsquo;s cry that, shrieking
into the gloom,<br />
Like a hand that closed on your soul clutching it from its
doom?<br />
Was it a mother&rsquo;s call, or the touch of a baby&rsquo;s
kiss,<br />
That followed your desperate soul down the black abyss?</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>What did you see&mdash;as you stood
on the other side&mdash;<br />
A strange shy soul amongst souls, did you seek to hide<br />
From the ghosts that were who judged you upon your way,<br />
Reckoned your sins against theirs for the judgment day?</p>
<p class="poetry">You feared the world, the pity of men or their
scorn,<br />
The movements of fate and the sorrows for which you were born.<br
/>
Men&rsquo;s laughter, men&rsquo;s speech, their judging, what was
it to this<br />
Where the eyes of the dead proclaim you have done amiss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not peace did you gain, perhaps, nor the rest
you had planned,<br />
&rsquo;Neath the horrible countless eyes that you could not
withstand?<br />
Or was it God looked from his throne in a moment&rsquo;s
disdain,<br />
And you shrieked for a trial once more in the height of your
pain?</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Perhaps&mdash;but who
knows&mdash;when you struggled so hard for life&rsquo;s
breath,<br />
You saw nothing passing the grave except silence and death,<br />
You lay shut in by the four clay walls of your cell,<br />
There the live soul locked up in the stiff dead body&rsquo;s
shell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dead, dead and coffin&rsquo;d, buried beneath
the clay,<br />
And still the living soul caged in to wait decay,<br />
For ever alone in night of unlifting gloom<br />
There to think, and think, and think, in the silent tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or was it in death&rsquo;s cold land there was
no perfume<br />
Of the scented flowers, or lilt of a bird&rsquo;s gay tune.<br />
No sea there, or no cool of a wind&rsquo;s fresh breath,<br />
No woods, no plains, no dreams, and alas! no death?</p>
<p class="poetry">Was there no life there that man&rsquo;s brain
could understand?<br />
No past, no future, hopes to come, in that strange land?<br />
No human love, no sleep, no day, no night,<br />
But ever eternal living in eternal light?</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Perhaps the soul thus springing to
fill its grave,<br />
Found all the peace and happiness that it could crave;<br />
All it had lost alone was that poor body&rsquo;s part<br />
Which naught but grey corruption saw for its chart.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah well! for us there ended all one man&rsquo;s
life with this&mdash;<br />
A shot, a cry, a struggle, and a fainting woman&rsquo;s kiss;<br
/>
Life&rsquo;s blood let &rsquo;mid the grasses&mdash;and all a
world was lost,<br />
And no one may ever know how he paid the cost.</p>
<p class="poetry">He is lost in the crowd of the dead, in the
night-time of death,<br />
A name on a stone left to tell that he ever drew breath.<br />
So desperate body die there, with your soul&rsquo;s long
release,<br />
And unhappy spirit God grant you Eternity&rsquo;s peace!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
